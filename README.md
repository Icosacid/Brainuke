## Navigation
* Save player's name in variable which will be used in score screen

## Game session
### UI
* Add SVG text for the note detected by the microphone (under the requested note?)
* Add remove note function
* Add buttons/list for predefined sequences
* Add progression/XP/score bar
* Add feedback animation when note is performed with success
### Preparation phase
* Add preparation phase boolean variable
* Allow drag & drop, removal and adding only in preparation phase
* Swap positions as well when randomizing, not just the order in the players array
* Implement drag&drop
### Sound
* (All done?)
### Notes sequences
* Add predefined sequences (array of notes)

## Design
* Add background for game screen
* Smooth transition between screens (find some trick, since angluar ng-show/ng-hide directives force the CSS property display:none)


# Discussion
* Shall we do the two modes, practice VS live stream? (like step-by-step VS guitar hero)
* Shall we include time in practice mode to get more XP/score in the bar?
